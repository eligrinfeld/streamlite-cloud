"LIKE THE PRODUCTS BUT THIS WAS NOT A POSITIVE INTERACTION. PAID HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS, INCORRECT ORDER FULFILLMENT AND I HAVE TO PAY TO FIX IT."
"IF THEY HAVE ISSUES WITH THE WEBSITE, IT WILL BE FRUSTRATING FOR THEM ALTHOUGH I LIKE THE PRODUCT AND HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY HAD ISSUES USING THE WEBSITE."
BECAUSE I'M FRUSTRATED RIGHT NOW.
BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND I'VE ALREADY SEEN HUGE RESULTS IN MY OWN EXPERIENCES AND OTHERS I'VE HELPED GET ONTO THE 30 DAYS PROGRAM.
I ASKED A QUESTION AND DID NOT RECEIVE AN ANSWER.
GREAT PROGRAM!!!
J'AI DÛ TÉLÉPHONER 4 FOIS ET ONT FINALEMENT RECONNU L'ERREUR SANS LA CORRIGER ET EN PLUS VOTRE SONDAGE EST EN ANGLAIS ALORS QUE JE COMMANDE EN FRANÇAIS.
"I LOVE THESE PRODUCTS   I'VE USED A LOT OF THE NUTRITION
PRODUCTS AND THE RESULTS SHOW DRAMATICALLY"
I LIKE THE PRODUCTS. I DON'T HAVE COMPLETE TRUST IN THE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT OF THE WEBSITE AND SHIPPING.
NO CONTACT AT ALL . THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES
I STILL LOVE THE PRODUCT AN EVERYTHING THE COMPANY IS ABOUT
MY EXPERIENCE WAS NOT ENJOYABLE
MOST OF THE PRODUCTS ARE GREAT
DECIDED NOT TO BE A CONSULTANT ANYMORE
THE PRODUCTS ARE GOOD BUT I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SUPPORT ME TO AMEND A MISTAKE
I LOVE ARBONNE AND ALL THAT WE STAND FOR. I JUST FIND ONE PARTICULAR CUSTOMER SERVICE REP QUITE RUDE AND UNHELPFUL.
SHOW RESPONSE AND NO RESOLUTION
THE PRODUCT IS GREAT .... THE EASE OF GETTING THROUGH TO YOU IS NOT .... 15 MINS ON THE PHONE PRIOR TO ANSWERING MY CALL ..... THEN UNABLE TO HELP OR FORWARD ME TO SOMEONE WHO COULD
THE WOMEN WAS NOT INTERESTED IN MY PROBLEM AT ALL.
ONLY ORDER IF YOU DON'T MIND HOW LONG YOUR PRODUCTS TAKE TO COME.
BECOUSE I LOVE THE PRODUCT HAVE BEEN DOING ME GOOD .
I LOVE THE PRODUCTS.
GET BETTER DEALS AS A PC THAN A CONSULTANT UNLESS YOUR AN ELITE SELLER
SEE ABOVE
LENGTH OF TIME TO RECEIVE ORDER IS UNACCEPTABLE.  THE FEE WAS TAKEN FROM MY ACCOUNT THE SAME DAY.
THE PRODUCTS ARE GREAT BUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR CONSULTANTS HAS BEEN UNACCEPTABLE.
"I HOPE MY DM, PCS SND ICS ALL GET BETTER SERVICE!"
"I'M AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT SO YES, I WILL RECOMMEND THE PRODUCTS BUT I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BY CUSTOMER SERVICE."
"ARBONNE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE VERY EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS.  HOWEVER,  MY CLIENTS HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED BY THE CONSTANT CHANGES TO THEIR FAVORITE PRODUCTS THAT EITHER GET DISCONTINUED OR CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE RE9 NECK CREAM WAS VERY GOOD."
BECAUSE IT IS NOT AN EASY COMPANY TO DEAL WITH
PRODUCTS ARE EXCELLENT
SHIPPING IS TOO EXPENSIVE OTHER COMPANIES SPEND $50.00 FREE SHIPPING..  PAULAS CHOICE AND THE INKEY LIST TO NAME A COUPLE..
I LOVE YOUR PRODUCTS. BUT THINK SOME OF YOUR POLICIES COULD USE WORK.
THIS IS MY FIRST ISSUE SO STILL RECOMMEND JUST WISH WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN MY PREFERRED CLIENT HER ORDER
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE OUR PRODUCTS!!!
NOT CONFIDENT THAT MY SHIPPING ADDRESS WAS CORRECTED.
BECAUSE IT IS TRULY A GOOD PRODUCT. ONE THING THAT IS HARD FOR PEOPLE TO UNDER STAND IT IS HOW YOU CHARGE TAX ON SRP. THEY SHOULD JUST ADJUST PRICE ACCORDINGLY SO PEOPLE AREN'T SO CONFUSED. THEY THINK THEY'RE GETTING A GREAT DEAL BUT TAXES ARE SO MUCH IN
DON'T WANT TO BUY ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THE CONFUSION REGARDING PRICING.
FRUSTRATED WITH LACK OF INFORMATION AND BEING ON HOLD FOR 30 MINUTES
JUST BECAUSE A CUSTOMER SERVICE GUY DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE DOESN'T MEAN THE PRODUCTS ARE NOT AWESOME.
THEY DIDNT HELP ME PROCESS THE ORDER
BEEN A LONG TIME CUSTOMER.
YOUR ONLINE IS A PROBLEM FOR ME
THE PACKAGING NEEDS TO BE RECYCLABLE. I WILL START RESEARCHING OTHER BEAUTY BRANDS WITH LESS/RECYCLABLE PACKAGING
THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT MAKING MONEY AND NOT ASSISTING THE CONSUMER
WHERE ARE MY ITEMS?
I LOVE ARBONNE'S PRODUCTS.
"LOVE THE PRODUCT, BUT HAVE BEEN UNHAPPY WITH MY PAST SEVERAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES."
I'VE ALWAYS HAD PROBLEMS WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THIS COMPANY.
LOVE THE PRODUCTS AND TYPICALLY HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THE SITE. NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING ON.
PISSED OFF THAT I HAD TO HEAR THAT MY ORDER GOT DELIVERED TO WRONG PERSON THROUGH AN EMAIL!
I'VE USED ARBONNE PRODUCTS FOR YEARS BUT THIS ISSUE SHOULD HAVE BEEN EASILY RESOLVED AND IT WAS NOT.
MY AUNT IS A CONSULTANT FOR ARBONNE AND LOVES YOUR PRODUCTS.
I'VE BEEN A CUSTOMER SINCE 2005 AND TRULY LOVE THE ARBONNE PRODUCTS.
"WHEN YOU HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT AND DISCONTINUE IT WITH NO RESPONSE IF IT WILL BE BACK OR IF THERE IS A REPLACEMENT, LEAVES A CUSTOMER UNHAPPY."
I LIKE MOST OF THE PRODUCTS BUT NOT THESE AND WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE BEING DIFFICULT I WILL HAVE A HARD TIME RECOMMENDING THESE ITEMS
I ALWAYS GIVE ARBONNE A 10 BUT CUSTOMER SERVICE USED TO BE A 10. THIS DEPARTMENT IN MY 9 YEARS HAS BECOME MORE OF A 5. I TRULY HOPE ARBONNE SPENDS QUALITY TIME AND MONEY TO BRING THIS CRUCIAL AREA OF THE COMPANY BACK UP TO WHERE IT WAS!!!!!! PLEASE CALL M
"I WILL ALWAYS RECOMMEND ARBONNE. HOWEVER, I NEVER RECOMMEND CUSTOMER SERVICE; I JUST CALL ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENT."
"FOR PRODUCT, DEFINITELY"
INCONSISTENT COMMUNICATIONS
BECAUSE I LOVE THE PRODUCTS.
CALL OR EMAIL ME.
I CAN'T CHECKOUT
"I LOVE ARBONNE, I JUST THINK THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE COULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED DIFFERENTLY."
NOT HANDLED
"LOVE THE PRODUCTS, JUST ANNOYED WITH THIS SITUATION"
I LOVE YOUR PRODUCTS BUT CUSTOMER SERVICE ISN'T GOOD
"IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN, IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RESPONSE"
I ENJOY ARBONNE AND AS A PC I EXPECTED BETTER SERVICE.
NOT HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME
"I BELIEVE IN FLOURISHING! I LOVE THE CLEAN, VEGAN AND CERTIFIED PRODUCTS. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE, EVER! I WANT THE WHOLE WORLD TO KNOW! A FEW INCONVENIENT AND UNTRAINED PERSONS ON A PHONE CALL IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT!"
NOT MAKING IT EASY TO DO BUSINESS FOR YOUR PREFERRED CUSTOMERS
I LOVE ARBONNE AND THIS BUSINESS AND I WILL SAY 99.9999% OF THE TIME MY CALLS WITH VP SUPPORT ARE AMAZING AND HANDLED WELL (AND I FILL OUT THE SURVEY TO SAY SO) AND EVEN WITH TOUGH CALLS WE GET THROUGH IT AND MAKE IT RIGHT.  BUT THIS CALL WAS NOT A GOOD O
BECAUSE ARBONNE IS THE BEST. HANDS DOWN
